# Supermarket-Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard for a supermarket typically displays key metrics and insights related to sales performance, inventory management, customer analytics, supply chain, employee performance, store operations, promotions, financial metrics, and customer satisfaction. The specific content would be tailored to the supermarket's goals and data sources, allowing for dynamic and interactive reporting.

## Objectives

A Power BI supermarket dashboard aims to sell more products, manage inventory effectively, make customers happy, run the store smoothly, ensure timely product deliveries, optimize advertising, maintain financial health, make wise expansion decisions, keep employees satisfied, and follow rules for a safe and successful operation.

#### Cleaning and Analyzing using Power Query
- Open Excel and connect to your Supermarket data.
- Use Power Query to clean and transform the data.
- Create a copy template for one sheet in Power Query transformations and apply the same transformations to all sheets.
- Apply all necessary cleaning steps, such as removing duplicates, renaming columns, and changing data types (As it is a clean data, I have skipped this step)
- Create a parameter to select the desired data based on a specific condition.
- Encapsulate all steps into a function to be reused for future sheets and data.
- Load and Apply the cleaned data into Power BI.
